VirusTotal for Android provides valuable insights into potential malware threats on your device, including viruses, trojans, and worms. It offers the convenience of scanning applications through over 70 antivirus engines, promptly flagging any suspicious content. However, it's essential to recognize that VirusTotal for Android serves as a supplementary tool rather than a standalone antivirus solution. It does not offer real-time protection. Therefore, users should still employ dedicated antivirus software for comprehensive device security. VirusTotal for Android offers a second opinion to enhance users' awareness of their application security status.
